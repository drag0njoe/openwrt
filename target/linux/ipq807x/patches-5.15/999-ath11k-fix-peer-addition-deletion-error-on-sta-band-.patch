Subject: [RFC PATCH] ath11k: fix peer addition/deletion error on sta band
 migration

This patch try to fix the following error.

Wed Jun  1 22:19:30 2022 kern.warn kernel: [  119.561227] ath11k c000000.wifi: peer already added vdev id 0 req, vdev id 1 present
Wed Jun  1 22:19:30 2022 kern.warn kernel: [  119.561282] ath11k c000000.wifi: Failed to add peer: 28:c2:1f:xx:xx:xx for VDEV: 0
Wed Jun  1 22:19:30 2022 kern.warn kernel: [  119.568053] ath11k c000000.wifi: Failed to add station: 28:c2:1f:xx:xx:xx for VDEV: 0

Wed Jun  1 22:19:31 2022 daemon.notice hostapd: wlan1: AP-STA-DISCONNECTED 28:c2:1f:xx:xx:xx
Wed Jun  1 22:19:31 2022 daemon.info hostapd: wlan1: STA 28:c2:1f:xx:xx:xx IEEE 802.11: disassociated due to inactivity
Wed Jun  1 22:19:32 2022 daemon.info hostapd: wlan1: STA 28:c2:1f:xx:xx:xx IEEE 802.11: deauthenticated due to inactivity (timer DEAUTH/REMOVE)

To repro this:
Have 2 Wifi with the same bssid and pass on different band (2.4 and
5GHz)
Enable 802.11r Fast Transaction with same mobility domain
FT Protocol: FT over the Air
From a openwrt system issue the command (with the correct mac)
ubus call hostapd.wlan1 wnm_disassoc_imminent '{"addr":"28:C2:1F:xx:xx:xx"}'
Notice the log printing the errors.

The cause of this error has been investigated and we found that this is
related to the WiFi Fast Transaction feature. We observed that this is
triggered when the router tells the device to change band. In this case
the device first auth to the other band and then the disconnect path
from the prev band is triggered.
This is problematic with the current rhash implementation since the
addrs is used as key and the logic of "adding first, delete later"
conflicts with the rhash logic.
In fact peer addition will fail since the peer is already added and with
that fixed a peer deletion will cause unitended effect by removing the
peer just added.

Current solution to this is to add additional logic to the peer delete,
make sure we are deleting the correct peer taken from the rhash
table (and fallback to the peer list) and for the peer add logic delete
the peer entry for the rhash list before adding the new one (counting as
an error only when a peer with the same vlan_id is asked to be added).

With this change, a sta can correctly transition from 2.4GHz and 5GHZ
with no drop and no error are printed.
